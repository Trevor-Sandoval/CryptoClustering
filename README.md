Please note that some portions of my code's structure were inspired by my research on the internet in addition to the hyperlinked module resources emailed to us by Melissa Conner. At the beginning of this boot camp, we were encouraged to be proactive with utilizing the internet as a resource for finding solutions to complex problems that also contributed to our edification. Thus, I was able to formulate my assignment after conducting some independent research on Stack Overflow and Google Search.
